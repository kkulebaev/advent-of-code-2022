# Advent of code 2022

[Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ an annual event in December since 2015.
Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-four days.
A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provides any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice.

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022][aoc2022] puzzles.
